## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am El-Amine Bendaas, a **Front End Web Developer** (specializing in **React Applications**). I am also Pursuing my Bachelor in **Economics & Concentration in Computer Science** and will graduate in mid-2025.

👨‍💻 I enjoy creating projects and programming in because it's a forever changing/evolving space which keeps me learning forever.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **working out**, **running**, **sketching**, and **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand**.

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development**. My favorite ones are **The Meditations** by _Marcus Aurelius_ and **Atomic Habits** by _James Clear_ and many other books.

✈️ I love **traveling** too. I have been on trips to **Portugal**, **Spain, Algeria, France, Cuba** in the past years.
